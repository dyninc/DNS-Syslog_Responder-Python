Example script for failing over a set of standard zones based on the syslog notification of an Active Failover Zone. This script is meant to be run with a rules set of 50 or less. The script is NOT a production read script, it is merely an example. For example there is no in depth logging, no security (or firewall security) and the actions are very basic doing no checking. It is a good place to start when catching syslog notifications though. See bottom of README for the full license text
